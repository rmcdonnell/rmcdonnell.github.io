The statistical language R, and the package RStudio is what really made me fall in love with programming.

 I started using it during a two part Probability & Statistics class at [Augsburg College](http://www.augsburg.edu]). The professor introduced the language to us and I instantly wanted to apply what I learned in class to the biophysics research I was doing. My mentor Dr. Matthew Beckman, had students who worked under him using MatLab, but I persuaded him into using R to perform the statistical analysis we needed to do.
